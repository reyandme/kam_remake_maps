A mission by Vatrix

BigDesc
    In his greed for gold, food, and weapons, your brother has pillaged your village that neighbors and casually trades with his empire and burnt it to the ground! Even though your army was too far away to save your defenseless village, some of your villagers, in disbelief, have fled to the north and have sent word to you of your brother's dastardly deed! They happily volunteered to return to what remains of their home to aid you to give this traitor what he deserves!                                      After he already sent most of his army to destroy more of your villages, your brother has heard that some of your villagers have escaped, and he knows that you have become aware of his treachery sooner than he planned. As a quick precaution before his army returns, he has burned all course work on metallurgy in all nearby towns. Your villagers have been primarily traders, and so your brother's failure to prevent you from obtaining gold and iron weapons shall cost him his empire!
