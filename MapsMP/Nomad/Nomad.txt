We've been spotted by a pack of circling vultures high in the clear blue sky for some days now. Only snakes and scorpions reign under the scorching sun in these forsaken lands so it seems. When our water supplies ran out completely our hope faded as well. But then a scout reported new water resources in sight! Still, as nomads this is our way of life. We are always on the move. Now that we found ourselves a safe haven we will defend it no matter the cost!||Made by To||To's difficulty ratings:|loc 1  ****|loc 2  ***|loc 3  **|loc 4  *****|loc 5  ***|loc 6  *|loc 7  ****|loc 8  ***|loc 9  **|loc 10 ***|loc 11 *|loc 12 ****||Tribute to the map 'Nomad' found in the Age Of Empires series.
