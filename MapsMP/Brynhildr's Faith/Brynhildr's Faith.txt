She was looking a little further when found one.. bit it just to taste it in raw form.. Not a single moment needed her pupiles got to be opened up as much that could see the darkness of the universe in it. Her pupils got as opened that her iris's got to be disappearing, also she started to feeling her 8th sense of her body. She was straight standing and saw the edge of the forest at the other side of the mountain. But her sense suddenly signaled her body, her eyes still could not focus the very near things, but felt it strongly..2 fat piggies were running towards her. Piggie MaMa and Piggie PaPa.||  Brynhildr wasn't strong, or more than us.|  As Piggie papa attacked from front side she got the move to reach her sword from her back, sliced and diced, papa got into half, Piggi mama was coming from right, but as Brynhild's b**bs was bouncing back from the ground, she used that impulse and force for lifting up the sword cutting mama half too..Two piggies came and now four lay next to her.||  Now Brynhildr does not want to walk on ground.|  Bryn got the moves, and her bloody sword hanged in her hand touching the ground, the blood was flowing down on her face, her pulse was up to 169BPM and was sweatting as jellyfish in a pan. She's still in the zone of 8th sense by the mushroom and still could not calm down and probably still seeing the other side of the mountain..|
