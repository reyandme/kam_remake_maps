Mexi and koczis12 were walking through the desert. At some point they had an argument, and Mexi slapped Koczis in the face. Koczis was hurt, but without saying anything, he wrote in the sand: "TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE."|They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. Koczis got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but Mexi saved him. After Koczis recovered from nearly drowning, he wrote on a stone: "TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE."|Mexi who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand, but now you write on a stone... why?"|Koczis replied: "When someone hurts us, we should write it in sand... where the winds of forgiveness can erase it from view. But, when someone does something good for us, we should engrave it in stone... where no wind can ever remove it."|SO, WRITE YOUR HURTS IN THE SAND, AND FORGET THEM.|BUT CARVE YOUR BENEFITS IN STONE, TO BE REMEMBERED||Made by sado
