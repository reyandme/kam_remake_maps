1:Dear king Hermedian, thank you for your help in the rebuild of Ferden. The recent wars did not serve anyone. They were just a craving for those who, despite their status, always wanted more. It is great to be able to travel safely through the boundless lands of our kingdom again. May there always be agreement between our countries.
